  det3: "The pandemic has changed a lot from what we wear and how we style to how we shop. Some think that the pandemic has helped them find their styles. This time, we wanted to come up with something fresh and cheerful to share the inspiration of the sunshine cities of the West Coast of America. Think Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and San Francisco for that laid-back style that looks so effortless and cool. We’ve taken inspiration from the decadent Art Deco buildings with their chalked pastels shaded back with hot, warm bright colors. By focusing on subtle and effortless looks, we think that the perfect look that captures the positivity and optimism the world has been missing of late.",
